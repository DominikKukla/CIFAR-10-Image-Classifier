# The  CIFAR-10 dataset classification

This project was jointly developed by:
- [Dominik Kukla](https://github.com/DominikKukla)
- [Dzmitry Pihulski](https://github.com/DzmitryPihulski)

## Description
In this repo, some basic models of deep learning were compared in the classification:

[The CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

The models are:

* Simple CNN model
* More complex CNN model with drop-out
* ResNet18
* VGG11

Models architecture was coded in [models file](/utils/models.py).

The training dataset was augmented with [transform_pipeline](/utils/utils.py)

Examples of transfromations are:
